# Offers Decision Engine - Create, manage, and personalize each customer’s “next best offer” from one system.

## Lab Overview

In this lab you'll use the Offers Decisioning Engine to create 2 offers. One for wealth management and one for an auto loan. Both of these offers will have representations for an email banner, text email and a mobile text. We will define rules to present the “best product” offer to a customer across multiple channels.


## Use Case
As a brand, we've invested heavily in personalizing customer experiences. Now, we want to be as contextual and relevant with offers for our customers.
We now understand our customer's behaviour and we want to deliver the right personalized offer and the right time from a central library of marketing offers.
